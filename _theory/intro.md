1. A Bioinformatician's Life
    1. Writing lots and lots of (often messy) code in several different languages
    2. 50% of your time is spent converting one file format to another
    3. Interact with lots of (especially non-computational) people
    4. Most people have no idea what you do!
2. The Bioinformatics Project Lifecycle
    1. A colleague comes to you with a dataset and asks you to analyze it
    2. You gather requirements about the analysis and match it to a technical solution
    3. You implement the solution and generate some preliminary results
    4. Your colleague looks at the results and assesses whether they asked you to do
       the thing they wanted you to do
    5. You take your colleague's feedback and incorporate it into your solution
    6. Go to step 4 and repeat
3. The Script: The Fundamental Unit of Bioinformatics Engineering
    1. A script is a file that contains code that can be executed
    2. Transforms a set of input files into one or more output files
    3. Scripts evolve: implement, execute, evaluate, repeat
    4. Workflows are composed of independent scripts that work together
4. Course Logistics
    1. W/F 12:20-2:05
    2. Location: [EPC 209](https://www.bu.edu/cpo/project/engineering-product-innovation-center/)
    3. Lectures divided into "theory" and "practice" sections
        1. "Theory" - high level/abstract concepts from various different fields
        2. "Practice" - specific tools and techniques you will use in your project
    4. Practice-based: you will learn key skills through exercises
    5. Project-based
        1. You will implement a realistic microbial genome analysis pipeline
        2. You will learn and use best-practices for writing code, workflow management,
           and reproducibility

title: Gene Finding with RAST
---

## Background

Genomes are linear molecules of nucleotides that encode gene sequences and the
organizing architecture required to transcribe them into functional products.
Gene sequences themselves are interspersed throughout the genome sequence itself
and it is not immediately clear where they are. Computational gene annotation is
the process of searching a genome sequence for shorter genes based on a number of
different properties, including codon usage, promotor sequence signals, et c.
RAST is a tool commonly used for finding and annotating genes in microbial sequences.

## Problem statement

Use RAST to annotate genes on a complete microbial genome.

## Normal Mode

Normal mode is intended for students who have little computational experience. The
instructions are more detailed and the task is relatively simple.

### Inputs

* A fasta formatted file of a genome

### Outputs

* A gff formatted file containing the annotated genes found by RAST

### Instructions

Concise description of what this script should do

### Hits

Some items that help guide the student through the process, including
references to specific techniques, commands, etc

## Challenge Mode

Challenge mode is intended for students who are already competent in programming
and CLI usage. This should be a similar but more involved/difficult version of
the normal mode task.

### Inputs

* Same as normal mode

### Outputs

* Same as normal mode

### Instructions

Concise description of what this script should do

### Hints

Might only give hints for particularly tricky aspects of challenge mode.
